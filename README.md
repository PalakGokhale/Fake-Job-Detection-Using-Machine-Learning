# Fake-Job-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Detecting fake job postings using machine learning involves building a classifier that can differentiate between genuine and fraudulent job listings.

Several tools and libraries are commonly used in the development of machine learning models for fake job detection.
Python: Python is a widely-used programming language for machine learning tasks due to its extensive libraries and ease of use.

Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It offers various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model selection.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.
Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series data, making it useful for tasks such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for multidimensional arrays, mathematical functions, linear algebra, and random number generation, which are essential for many machine learning algorithms.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python that produces publication-quality figures in a variety of formats. Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Word Embedding Models (Word2Vec, GloVe): Word embedding models are used to convert textual data into numerical representations. Word2Vec and GloVe are popular algorithms for learning distributed representations of words in vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words based on their contexts.

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab: Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs for running Jupyter notebooks in the cloud, making it suitable for training deep learning models on large datasets.
